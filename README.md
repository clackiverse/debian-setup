# Debian setup

## purpose
This repository holds the setup script for my development environment.  This gets any machine or vm quickly in the state I like for doing development.

## use
run the script using:

`./setup.sh`

Some setups are run as SUDO, so it will prompt when necessary.

As some steps are user specific, do not add `sudo` before script file.
